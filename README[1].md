This is a simple program that calculates the love compatibility score between two individuals. The program prompts the user to input their name and their partner's name, and then calculates the score based on the number of letters that match the words "true" and "love" in the combined names.

How to Use
To use the program, simply run the script and follow the prompts. The program will ask for the first name of the user and their partner's name. After entering the names, the program will calculate the compatibility score and display the result.

If the compatibility score is less than 10 or greater than 90, the program will display a message stating "Your love score is [compatibility score], you go together like coke and mentos." If the score is between 40 and 50 (inclusive), the program will display a message stating "Your love score is [compatibility score], you are alright together." Otherwise, the program will simply display the compatibility score without any additional message.
